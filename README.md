# code-formatter
My preferred code format settings.
* Line width set to 120.
* Comment width set to 80.
* Switch statements indented.
* Empty brackets on one line.
* Full brackets start on same line, and end one line after code.
* Spaces before first/last method/variable.
* JavaDocs don't split up words in @param into columns.
